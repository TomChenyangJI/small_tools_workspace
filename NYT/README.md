Since I am living a country where I cannot access `New York Times` easily, and due to its subscription of service in order to get the full access to many articles, which is also a banking problem for us in our country, I decided to program this small web-spider to read the news from NYT in order to make it easy for me read the headlines. It can be used to download the news on the homepage collevtively, or to download the specific webpage.
