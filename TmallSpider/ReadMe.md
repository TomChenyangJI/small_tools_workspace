## Context
This program is still waiting my further effort and need to be cracked.
It came from the background when I tried to buy a second-hand mobile phone on an e-commerce platform, called `idle fish`.
But these days, many second-hand products displayed on this platform are not geniune, and it you cannot identify it before your visit the sellers' homepage.
Therefore I decided to create a web-spider to collect the info of my desired products.
But due to the crpted dataflow between end and end devices, it would take a lot of time to crack it.
What's more important is that I decided to buy a whole brand-new phone, which means I didn't need it any more, therefore I decided to leave it alone.
That's why I still haven't finished it.
