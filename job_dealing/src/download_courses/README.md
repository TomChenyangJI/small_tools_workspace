## Context
This program is designed to `download some courses` that I wished to learn/watch from internal website when my devices were `offline` with the intention of boosting my working skills, without spreading them in public.

`note` Since this is an open repo, I have to erase the senstive info in the scripts, including the links to the website where I downloaded courses.
