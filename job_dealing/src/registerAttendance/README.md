## Context
There were a few times when I forgot to `register my attendance` in the morning at the beginning of my working days and my duty-off moment in the evening when I headed back home. And that was annoying for me because I had to submit the application to cancel the false absence records. Sometimes I might not notice that I hadn't registered my attendance, which would come with an absence fine (no salary for that working day).

In order to solve this problem, I decided to crack the attendance-registration function in the internal app so that I didn't need to worry about forgetting my attending records anymore, which had made my working life easier. This is what I had done.

`note` It was impossible to register my attendance without showing up in the office because every moring we had to attend in-person meeting and I sat just next to my manager -_-. If I registered my attendance without showing up, my manager would know it. So this script just helped make my working life easier other than commit office fraud.
