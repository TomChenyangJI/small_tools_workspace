## Context
This idea comes from a rainy night when I just came out the room and found the rain was heavy.
Since I didn't bring an umbrella, and I was new to that place, the only choice left was waiting it get slight.
Therefore, I created this small program to `remind me of the weather on a daily basis in the morning with an email noticification`,
because I found these days, we were fed up with noticification from mass apps, but this program only remind you once a day, 
which is totally tolerable.

### Further Plan
I think  this idea can be tranferred to some official program to provide this service for the whole community.
